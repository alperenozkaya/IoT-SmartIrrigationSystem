# IoT Smart Irrigation System

This repository contains the source code for a smart irrigation system prototype, designed to optimize the watering process for plants by considering various environmental parameters.

## Project Overview 
Our system effectively utilizes information about the current environmental light conditions, soil moisture levels of the plant, and the water level in the attached tank to enable efficient irrigation. This dynamic approach allows for the best care for the plant while preserving water resources.





## Features

**Light Sensing:** We have incorporated a light sensor that determines the current light intensity of the environment. It helps optimize the watering process as per the day-night cycle and changing weather conditions.

**Soil Moisture Monitoring:** The system is equipped with a soil moisture sensor that keeps track of the water needs of the plant. It prevents overwatering and underwatering scenarios, thus ensuring the plant's optimal health.

**Water Level Management:** The system also monitors the water level in the attached tank to ensure a constant water supply for the plant.
Additionally, we have integrated the project with ThingSpeak, an IoT analytics platform, to collect, analyze, and visualize the data generated by the system.


## Mobile Application

To provide the user with a seamless and interactive experience, we have developed an Android application. This application not only allows users to analyze data on the go but also sends alerts in critical scenarios (e.g., low soil moisture, low tank water level), ensuring timely intervention.
